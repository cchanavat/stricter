\section*{Introduction}

\cccom{TODO}
\begin{itemize}
    \item review combinatorics of regular directed complexes, 
    \item functor \( \molecin{U} \)
    \item directed globes, say -1 is empty
    \item suspension, gray product of regular directed complexes and diagrammatic sets
    \item dual
    \item diamond transitive
    \item connected diagrammatic set
    \item read Henry regular polygraph and say it rectifies the problem
\end{itemize}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:diamond_transitive}
    \cccom{TODO}
    Any molecule is diamond transitive
\end{lem}
